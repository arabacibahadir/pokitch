## Brief

### How did we use _Supabase Realtime_ function?

We used Supabase Realtime for inserts and updates of poke's in our database. We used the event:"UPDATE" to check the realtime data of the active poke on the Twitch channel and update the overlay in realtime when its health is low. We used the event:"INSERT" to check if the active poke has been caught and swapped with the new random poke, and update the overlay with if there is the new data.

### How did we use _Supabase Database_?

Supabase Database is where we keep track of viewer poke collections and when on which Twitch channel they caught them.
